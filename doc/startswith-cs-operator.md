# startswith_cs operator

Filters a record set for data with a case-sensitive string starting sequence.

The following table provides a comparison of the `startswith` operators:

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`startswith`](startswith-operator.md) |RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" startswith "fab"`|
|[`!startswith`](not-startswith-operator.md) |RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !startswith "kam"`|
|[`startswith_cs`](startswith-cs-operator.md)  |RHS is an initial subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" startswith_cs "Fab"`|
|[`!startswith_cs`](not-startswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't an initial subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !startswith_cs "fab"`|

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the table above:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression

For further information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md). 

## Performance tips

[!INCLUDE [performance-tip-note](../../includes/performance-tip-note.md)]

For faster results, use the case-sensitive version of an operator. For example, use `hassuffix_cs` instead of `hassuffix`.

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `startswith_cs` `(`*expression*`)`  

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples -->
```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State startswith_cs "I"
    | where event_count > 2000
    | project State, event_count
```

**Output**

|State|event_count|
|-----|-----------|
|IOWA|2337|
|ILLINOIS|2022|
